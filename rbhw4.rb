#Write a program that translates one English word into Pig Latin. Because the rules for Pig Latin can vary, I'll be specific:
#If the given word starts with a consonant, move only that consonant to end and then add "ay" to the end (e.g.: coffee -> offeecay, blogger -> loggerbay)
#If the given word starts with a vowel, add "way" to the end of the word (e.g., office -> officeway)
