		<h2>Welcome Home.</h2>

	<p>The perfect end to any day is spent in the kitchen making<br>
		something delicious. Not only do I love to eat, but I also love to<br>
	cook. Match made in heaven! Although I find myself making the same<br>
few meals all the time. </p>

	<h3>These are my go-tos:</h3>

	<ol>
		<li><span id="first">Veggie Tex Mex Quinoa</span></li>
		<li><span id=:"second">Tikka Masala (Chicken or Veggie)</span></li>
		<li>Scramble Eggs, Bacon & Brussel Sprouts</li>
		<li>Chicken and Cheese Tosti's</li>
	</ol>
